# The Deal
The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal alternates between players. The dealer deals the first card face up for each player. The number face up is how many cards that player receiveds.The cards are dealt one by one, with the next card placed face-up to begin the discard pile. The remaining cards form the stock, placed face down.
* Example: Player #1 is dealt an 5, they receive 5 cards.
* Player #2 is dealt an 8, they receive 8 cards.
* Players dealt a 10, Jack, Queen or King received 10 cards
* Player dealt an Ace is dealt 11 cards.
* Whatever number the dealer is dealt is wild for that round.

# Object of the Game
The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand by melding, laying off, or discarding.
* **Melding:** Combining cards into sequences (runs) or groups (sets) and placing them face up on the table.
  * A sequence or run is 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4♣, 5♣, 6♣).
  * A group or set is 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., 7♦, 7♥, 7♠).
* **Laying Off:** Adding cards to a meld on the table. You cannot rearrange existing melds to add cards.
* **Discarding:** Placing a card from your hand on top of the discard pile. Place cards on the discard pile so all cards can be seen.

# Play
If there are two players, they alternate turns, starting with the non-dealer. For more than two players, turns are taken in clockwise order, beginning with the player to the dealer’s left. Each turn has the following steps:
1. **Draw:** Draw one card from either the stock or the discard pile. The stock is face down, while the discard pile is face up placed so all cards can be seen.
2. **Meld:** If you have valid sets or sequences, you may place as many combination face up on the table as player has.
3. **Laying Off:** Optionally, you can add cards to existing melds by placing them in your on meld and indicate where the card is play on.
4. **Laying Off On Other Players:** Players must have laid down a meld before they can add cards to other players’ melds.
5. **Wild Cards:** Cannot play more wild card then regular cards. (e.g. Jacks are wild. 2 Jack with 2 Queens)
6. **Pick up discard pile:** In order to pick up a discard card, player must be able to use it. (e.g. a player has a 3 in their hand and there are two 3’s in the discard pile. Player may pick all cards from the 3 to the end of the discard pile and must play the card that was pick up first.)
7. **Rummy:** If a player discards a card that can be played on the board. They first person who says Rummy, gets the Rummy card. Only the top card on the pile can be Rummied.
8. **Discard:** At the end of your turn, discard one card onto the discard pile. If you drew from the discard pile, you cannot discard the same card. Player do not have to have a discard to go out. If the stock is exhausted and no player wants the top card of the discard pile, the discard pile is reshuffled to create a new stock.

A player wins when they discard all their cards, which is known as “going out.”

# Scoring
When a player goes out, the other players calculate the value of the card left in their hands:
* Face cards (10, K, Q, J) are worth 10 points each.
* Wild card and Aces are worth 100 point each.
* Number cards are worth their face value (e.g., a 6 is worth 6 points).

The total value of the remaining cards in all other players’ hands is added to the winner’s score.

The player that goes out receives 150 points for going out.

The game continues until a player reaches 2000 points.
